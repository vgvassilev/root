## Removed interfaces

The following interfaces have been removed, after deprecation in v6.10.

### TTreeReader

`TTreeReader::SetLastEntry()` was replaced by `TTreeReader::SetEntriesRange()`.



## Core Libraries


## I/O Libraries

- Introduce TKey::ReadObject<typeName>.  This is a user friendly wrapper around ReadObjectAny.  For example
```{.cpp}
auto h1 = key->ReadObject<TH1>
```
after which h1 will either be null if the key contains something that is not a TH1 (or derived class)
or will be set to the address of the histogram read from the file.

## TTree Libraries

- Resolved O(N^2) scaling problem in ```TTree::Draw()``` observed when a branch that contains a
large TClonesArray where each element contains another small vector container.
- `TTree::Draw()` now creates double precision histograms (TH1D, TH2D, TH3D) by default (instead of TH1F etc); this can be configured in etc/system.rootrc / .rootrc as `Hist.Precision.1D` (or `2D` or `3D`).

## Histogram Libraries


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries


## 2D Graphics Libraries
  - The method TColor::InvertPalette inverts the current palette. The top color becomes
    bottom and vice versa. This was [suggested by Karl Smith](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/inverted-color-palettes/24826/2).
  - New method `TColor::SetColorThreshold(Float_t t)` to specify the color
    threshold used by GetColor to retrieve a color.
  - Improvements in candle plots:
    -  LogZ for violins
    -  scaling of candles and violins with respect to each other
    -  static functions for WhiskerRange and BoxRange
  - In some case it was not somme possible to zoom a 1D histogram using the mouse
    on the X axis. This was described
    [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/axis-blocked-when-overlaying-two-histograms/25326)
